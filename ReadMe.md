# Determination #
The objective of the `Determination` library is to provide determinism to unit tests.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) defines a deterministic algorithm as an [*algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm). Good unit tests are repeatable, they always produce the same results from a fixed set of inputs.  Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense but can be challenging in real practice: for example programming logic that depends on a current date or time might give different results as the current date or time changes.  That might be desirable for a software program, however it is not so for testing it; tests need to be consistent and therefore can't depend on the current date or time.

Solving this challenge might seem easy at first:  just provide the real date-time to the actual software, and substitute the value with a pre-defined one when running unit tests.  That solution works for many cases, but not all:  sometimes a test might need the date-time being used to be more like the real thing, for example when testing the passage of time.

Other examples of values that are non-deterministic are [`Globally Unique Identifiers`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) and values that are generated through randomization.
